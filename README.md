# pairedUp
A fun little online shopping android app for those looking for a pair
{Winner of Improve 10x Android Application Development Hackathon}


# What it's about
Don't you hate it when you have one of a pair- one sock, one shoe, one earring? And it renders the entire accessory irredeemable. But what if it could be saved? What if you could buy just one of a pair, save your closet, and get all of your stuff paired up?

# How it began
My friends and I signed up for a 3 day Android App Development bootcamp- 3 days to build an entire application starting with Kotlin, a language none of us knew yet. But by day 3, this was what we were able to create.
